# Todo Meteor and Angular App
## By Ashley Maceli

## Description

A simple Meteor and Angular app to manage a 'to do' list with features such as creating user accounts with login and logout features. Users may add or delete tasks and check them off as completed. Tasks may also be filtered to show only incomplete tasks. Users may choose tasks to be labeled as public or private which makes them hidden to others. Tasks are stored in a MongoDB collection.
